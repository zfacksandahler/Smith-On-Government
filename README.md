# Smith-On-Government

A collaborative annotated edition of Adam Smith's passages on government and the invisible hand.

## Project Purpose

This repository aims to collect and analyze passages from Adam Smith's *The Wealth of Nations* and *The Theory of Moral Sentiments* that relate to the role of government versus market forces. The project seeks to highlight the tension and interplay between the "invisible hand" of the market and the necessary functions of the state as understood by Smith.
